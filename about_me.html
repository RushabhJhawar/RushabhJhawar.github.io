									<h1>Overview</h1>
									<p>Business Analyst with more than a year of experience with a proven track record in delivering automated story-driven reports,

								<p>To give you a little background about myself, I come from Mumbai, India. 
									I graduated from NMIMS, completing a bachelor's in technology degree in Computer Science in 2020. 
									As a result of my passion for Analytics and Science, I targeted one of the companies offering me an analyst
									role during my campus placement and bagged the role. There I got to learn more about how  
									the project cycle works and what are the fundamental roles and responsibilities of working in the industry. Here, I helped 
								    developed a payment interface for the bank and leaded the collaboration with government.
								</p>

								<p>This experience propelled me to pursue a Masters degree in Business analytics. I'm currently a  
									student at Clark University, looking to polish my trade and also actively looking for internships 									automated report and incorporating feedback, and maintaining the project. I have worked in 
									in my domain. I am looking forward to working with a company where I could take my analytics to the
									next level and also in turn, share my knowledge and contribute to achieve the company goals.								as well.
								
								</p>

								<p>
								</p>

								<p>Sports has always been a constant in my journey. I have played soccer, volleyball and cricket at a 
									competitive level. The thrill I get from indulging in these sports helps me stay motivated and gives 
									me a greater perspective about how I can handle pressure situations in my life too. Other than that, 
									I like to read about current world affairs and invest in the stock market and I'm very fascinated to 
									acquire knowledge and experience of trading.
